Jabbermouth,"9:30 - Market opens green, you buy 0DTE puts because it’s a “bull trap”.
  
    10:00 - Market has pumped another .5% and you double down on your puts. You are down 30%.
  
    12:00 - Market has traded flat and your 0DTE puts are now worth 50% less than when you bought them this morning.
  
    1:30 - Market dips by .5% and you get a small spike to only -40% down on your puts. You don’t sell because “the rug pull is happening”.
  
    3:00 - Your puts are now -85% going into power hour. You stare at the screen hoping for red candles but they never come.
  
    3:58 - Your puts expire worthless, you mutter to yourself “this market is rigged, it has to come down eventually”. You buy more puts for Friday.

AlfrescoDog,"📰 Apple First Quarter Earnings Preview
  


    Apple (AAPL) will report its Q1 (Dec) earnings tonight after the close. There is a conference call scheduled for 17:00 ET.
  


Q1 FactSet consensus calls for EPS of $2.10 (versus $1.88 last year) on revenue of $118.0 bln (+1% yr/yr). The company said it expects Q1 revenue to be similar to last year; expects iPhone revenue to grow yr/yr; expects Mac and iPad performance to accelerate qtr/qtr. The company expects strong double-digit rate of growth in services; expects gross margins between 45-46%.



    Since the start of the pandemic, the company has switched from providing exact guidance in the press release to providing more vague guidance on the conference call. Q2 (Mar) FactSet consensus calls for EPS of $1.58 and revenue of $95.6 bln.
  


The Street is expecting Q1 iPhone revenue to be $66.5 bln vs. $65.8 bln last year, and services revenue of $22.5 bln vs. $20.8 bln last year.



    Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo posted that ""2024 iPhone shipments likely to decline significantly by about 15%.""
  


    In addition, any color on the launch of Vision Pro will be of note. Mac Rumors reported that Apple sold 200K Vision Pro headsets.
  


    AAPL has a $2.86 trillion valuation and currently trades at 28 times FY24 earnings.
  


    Based on the weekly AAPL Weekly Feb02 $185.00 straddle, the options market is currently pricing in a move of ~4% in either direction by weekly expiration (Friday).",2024-02-01T16:12:42.621Z
