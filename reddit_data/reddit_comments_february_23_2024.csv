generouscookie1981,"TL;DR - there has been a dramatic paradigm shift in the Fed's framework from reacting to crises to proactively preventing them with ample liquidity and reserves.  Yes 2024 is still lots of SPY calls. If you do not adapt you will be left behind.

    Two extremely important parts of the recent FOMC minutes people haven't talked about much.  First is that conditions remain very ample and credit is flowing nicely:
  

    Participants judged that liquidity in the financial system remained more than ample and discussed the importance of considering liquidity conditions as the Federal Reserve's balance sheet continues to normalize. While participants noted that they were not seeing any signs of liquidity pressures at banks, several participants noted that, as a matter of prudent contingency planning, banks should continue to improve their readiness to use the Federal Reserve's discount window, and that the Federal Reserve should continue to improve the operational efficiency of the window.
  

    There isn't really a reason to think Fed is trying to crash the economy with overly restrictive rates and making a policy error here.  Also by making sure banks are ready to use the discount window (pre-readying them with ""practice"" ahead of time), there will be yet another guardrail to prevent credit from seizing up down the road.  In other words the chance of a cascade of defaults and lots of layoffs is extremely low.
  
    The second is that they are going to start easing on QT and they stated it concretely:
  

    Participants observed that the continuing process of reducing the size of the Federal Reserve's balance sheet was an important part of the Committee's overall approach to achieving its macroeconomic objectives and that balance sheet runoff had so far proceeded smoothly. In light of ongoing reductions in usage of the ON RRP facility, many participants suggested that it would be appropriate to begin in-depth discussions of balance sheet issues at the Committee's next meeting to guide an eventual decision to slow the pace of runoff.
