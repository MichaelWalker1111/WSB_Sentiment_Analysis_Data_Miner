Since Reddit is IPOing soon. I got the idea to do some sort of analysis of one of their subreddits. I choose Wall Street Bets because of it's impact on the financial sector over COVID. In the future I'd like to compare and contrast the results of the sentiment of certain stocks versus how they actually performed.

The main issue in this is the data gathering. Reddit's API is behind a pay wall, so being a broke college student I decided to avoid this route. There were several blog posts online about how to effectively webscrape Reddit comments, but these were several years out of date and not applicable anymore--Reddit changed HTML format to try and force you to pay for their API. However, the core ideas were still applicable, so using this as a base and reworking it. I parsed the new HTML for the desired data--Author, Comment, datetime. I was able to gather 2000 comments from Febuary 28th. Of course, there are years worth of data still to collect, but this is just a start.
